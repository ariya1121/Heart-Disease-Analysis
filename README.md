## Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis 🫀

📜 Description

This project is focused on analyzing heart disease data to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals. Using various machine learning models and data visualization techniques, the notebook aims to provide insights into risk factors and the accuracy of predictive analytics.

### 🧑‍💻 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prediction can help in preventing severe outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning models to analyze a publicly available heart disease dataset, showcasing data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.

### 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

- Age
- Gender
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
  and more...
- Target variable: Presence or absence of heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

The dataset is processed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical data for better model performance.
